A simple JavaScript script to trigger the click action on a div developed in HTML.

To make animation possible, the animated element must be animated relative to a "parent container".

The containing element must be created with style = "position: relative".

The animation element must be created with style = "position: absolute".

JavaScript animations are achieved by programming incremental changes in the style of an element.

The changes are called by a timer. When the timer interval is small, the animation appears continuous.
